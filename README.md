...couldn't get the bloody workflow to build properly (edit: damn package-lock.json), so built locally then threw it up on Netlify here:

# Songs from the Gap: A Semantic Topology Sonification

**Songs from the Gap** is a mathematical sonic journey that transforms the semantic distance between Wikipedia articles into a multi-voiced melodic landscape. By projecting knowledge structures into a 2D manifold, the application allows users to select two disparate points of information and listen to the "bridge" that connects them.

## The Concept of the "Semantic Gap"

In traditional knowledge retrieval, we look at articles as isolated nodes. This application instead focuses on the **latent space** between them. 

When you select an **Origin** and a **Target**, the app identifies the "Gap"—the mathematical and structural vacuum between these two concepts. It then synthesizes a musical composition where the melody is not derived from the articles themselves, but from the **shared structural links** that inhabit the space between them.

## How it Works

### 1. Spatial Projection (The Manifold)
The application fetches articles within a specific radius of a geographic coordinate. It then performs a **Deterministic Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)** approach:
*   **Structural Analysis:** Every article's outgoing links are cross-referenced with every other article in the set.
*   **Jaccard Similarity:** We calculate a similarity matrix where $Sim(A, B) = \frac{|Links_A \cap Links_B|}{|Links_A \cup Links_B|}$.
*   **Force-Directed Layout:** Articles are projected into a 2D plane. Nodes that share a high degree of structural affinity "clump" together, while semantically distant concepts are pushed to the periphery.

### 2. Visual Symbology (The Web of Affinity)
When the articles load, you will notice a web of faint lines connecting various nodes. These are **Structural Affinity Indicators**:
*   **Lines:** A line indicates that two articles share at least one outgoing Wikipedia link.
*   **Weight & Opacity:** The visual strength of a line is mapped directly to the **Jaccard Similarity Coefficient**. Thick, bright lines represent strong conceptual bonds, while thin, ghostly lines represent tangential connections.
*   **Topology:** Clusters of densely connected lines reveal "Semantic Neighborhoods"—groups of articles that inhabit the same field of human knowledge.

### 3. The Orchestral Sonification Engine
The soundscape is composed of three distinct voices powered by high-quality acoustic samples (sourced from orchestral recording archives), with performance parameters driven by vector physics:

*   **The Solo Cello (Bass):** Rooted in the **Origin** node. Provides a rich tonal foundation. The pitch is transposed based on the $x$-coordinate of the gap's center.
*   **The String Ensemble (Harmony):** A lush pad whose pitch and pulsation rate (LFO-driven gain) are mapped to the **Gap Center's** $y$-coordinate. This creates a breathing atmospheric texture.
*   **The Celesta (Melody):** A bell-like pointillist voice that represents the "DNA" of the gap.
    *   **Note Selection:** The sequence is generated by iterating through the characters of the **Shared Links** (the intersection set).
    *   **Rhythmic Elasticity (Jitter):** The **Gap Distance** determines the rhythm's stability. A large vector distance (spanning dissimilar concepts) introduces "micro-timing jitter," making the rhythm feel unstable and syncopated.
    *   **Timbre (Brightness):** The **Semantic Affinity** controls a low-pass filter. High-affinity gaps sound bright and sharp, whereas low-affinity gaps sound dark and diffused.


### 4. Saving Your Discoveries
Should you encounter a gap whose sonic signature resonates with you, use the **Save to File** button (the download icon). The application will use an `OfflineAudioContext` to high-fidelity render the 32-step sequence and export it as a 16-bit PCM **WAV file** directly to your device.

## Technical Implementation

*   **React & Tailwind:** Responsive, glassmorphism interface optimized for high-density information display.
*   **Web Audio API:** Custom `MultiVoicePlayer` using recursive `setTimeout` for playback and `OfflineAudioContext` for rendering-to-file.
*   **Wikipedia API:** Real-time retrieval of geographic nodes and deep-link metadata for structural mapping.

## Usage

1.  **Anchor:** Use your current location or enter specific coordinates (e.g., for a city or landmark) to generate a local semantic field.
2.  **Select Origin:** Tap any node in the structural map.
3.  **Select Target:** Tap a second node. The "Vector Bridge" will appear.
4.  **Synthesize:** Click "Synthesize Gap" to begin the sonification.
5.  **Export:** If you like the result, click the download icon to save the WAV file.
